This waybar setup is from [mashumarodesu's work](https://github.com/mashumarodesu/dots), and I remove some components to make waybar's configuration simple and viable. 
(PS:A big part of the reason is that I don't really understand most of the custom script)

The color theme is taken from [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/waybar).
To change the color theme, suppose you want use another `catppuccin` theme, just replace the `Macchiato.css` with another color file from [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/waybar).(There is no need to modify `style.css`)
